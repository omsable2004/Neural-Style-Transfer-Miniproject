Neural Style Transfer
This repository contains an implementation of Neural Style Transfer (NST), a technique in deep learning used to blend the content of one image with the style of another. This method uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to transfer the artistic style of an image (like a painting) onto the content of another image (such as a photograph).

Overview
Neural Style Transfer combines the content of one image with the style of another using deep neural networks. By using pre-trained deep learning models, it captures the content and style features of the images and creates a new image that merges both.

In this project, the goal is to:

Extract and preserve the content from a content image.
Capture the style from a style image.
Combine both features to generate a stylized output image.
Requirements
Before running the code, ensure that the following dependencies are installed:

Python 3.6+
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on your preference, this implementation uses TensorFlow)
NumPy
Matplotlib
Pillow (PIL)
OpenCV (optional for image processing)
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib pillow opencv-python
Usage
1. Prepare the images
Content Image: The image you want to maintain the structure of (e.g., a photo).
Style Image: The image whose artistic style you want to apply (e.g., a painting).
2. Run the script
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/neural-style-transfer.git
cd neural-style-transfer
Run the script to perform Neural Style Transfer:

bash
Copy
Edit
python neural_style_transfer.py --content_image <path_to_content_image> --style_image <path_to_style_image> --output_image <path_to_output_image>
3. View the output
After running the script, the generated stylized image will be saved at the specified output path.

Code Explanation
Content Loss: Measures the difference between the content image and the generated image using the high-level features captured by the CNN.
Style Loss: Measures the difference in style between the style image and the generated image by comparing the correlations between different feature maps in the CNN.
Total Loss: A weighted combination of content loss and style loss used to optimize the generated image.
The model uses a pre-trained VGG-19 network to extract features from the images.

Example
bash
Copy
Edit
python neural_style_transfer.py --content_image images/photo.jpg --style_image images/painting.jpg --output_image output/result.jpg
This will combine the content of photo.jpg with the style of painting.jpg and save the result to result.jpg.

Results

Future Improvements
Experiment with different neural network architectures for better results.
Add the ability to adjust the influence of content and style separately.
Optimize for faster processing on GPU.
